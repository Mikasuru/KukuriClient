<h2>🚀 What is Kukuri Client?</h2>
<p>
  Kukuri Client is a selfbot I created after noticing that many users purchase selfbots with a lot of useless commands. 
  Kukuri Client is different. It's free, open-source, and focuses on providing only the most useful features you need. 
  Don't worry, Kukuri Client won't betray you!
</p>

<p>
  I've seen that many people want to try selfbots, but unfortunately, many of them have fallen victim to hacking by using free programs. 
  That's why Kukuri Client is here!
